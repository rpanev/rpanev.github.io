Everpad is an open source client for the fantastic note 🙂

<pre>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nvbn-rm/ppa

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install everpad </pre>

Once installed search for and run the ‘Everpad’ from the Unity Dash. You will then see the app indicator appear on your panel. Once it does, click on it and select “Settings & Management” then “Authorise” to configure Everpad with your Evernote account.

That’s it! Your notes will now start to sync with Ubuntu. Enjoy!
